    <h2>Position fixed;</h2>

    <p>
        An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
        The top, right, bottom,and left properties are used to position the element.The position property in CSS tells about the method of positioning for an element or an HTML entity and the positioning of an element can be done using the top, right, bottom, and left properties. 
        These specify the distance of an HTML element from the edge of the viewport.
